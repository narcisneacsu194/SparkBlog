# Spark Blog

This is a simple blog web application using the microframework Spark, and as a template, I used the Handlebars engine.

The main page displays a list of all the available posts of the site.

You can make simple posts that contain a title and the content of your post.

If you want to create or edit a post, you must provide a password first.

Comments can be added as well to a post.

A post can also be deleted.
